Contributing to Handly
======================

Thanks for your interest in this project.

Project description:
--------------------

The Eclipse Handly project aims to provide a foundation for 
construction of handle-based models not unlike the JDT Java Model 
in their essential qualities. It borrows from core design patterns 
and principles used in the Java Model, but aims for a generalized 
albeit partial basic implementation, on top of which complete handle-
based models of diverse kinds could be built with relative ease. 
The project includes a layer of integration with Xtext.

Handly is very much a work in progress. The intent is to come up 
with a really nice design in that problem area through an open and 
transparent development process informed by community feedback.

Your participation would be much appreciated. Bugzilla can be used 
to provide suggestions for enhancements and (obviously) report bugs. 
Questions can be sent to the project's users forum or developers 
mailing list. Please see the details below about contributing to 
the project.

Developer resources:
--------------------

Information regarding source code management, builds, coding standards, 
and more.

In particular, the Handly's build is based on Maven and Tycho (see 
the `build` project for the `pom.xml` file that drives the build)

Setting up a developer workspace:
---------------------------------

Handly currently uses `JavaSE-1.6` for compilation. Please add a matching JRE. 
Perfect match (i.e. JDK 1.6) is recommended to avoid build warnings.

Handly employs specific code formatting conventions. Please import and use 
the formatter profile from `tools/formatter.xml`.

To set up a workspace for the Handly Framework (as opposed to Handly Examples), 
import all projects located in the root of the git repository and set the 
target platform using a definition file in the `target` project.

For information on how to set up a workspace for Handly Examples, 
please see `examples/README`.
