Handly Examples
===============

Some examples of Handly usage are provided in bundles under the 
common `org.eclipse.handly.examples` namespace. Each example has its own 
namespace (e.g., `o.e.handly.examples.basic`) and the corresponding 
set of bundles. The root bundle for every example contains the 
accompanying `README` file.

You might want to clone the project's Git repository and set up 
a developer workspace to be able to play with the examples most 
productively. Please see the project's Developer Resources for 
information on setting things up.
